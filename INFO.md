With this skill you can maintain a third-party open-source license usage file
for your npm-based project.

-   Disclose your usage of third-party open-source software in your projects
    consistently across all your repositories
-   Never forget to update legal license files

Enable the skill with at least a contact email address, commit and push changes
to your package dependencies, and then see how the skill automatically updates
the license usage information!
